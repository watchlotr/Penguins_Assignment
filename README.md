# Reproducible_Figures_Assignment
These files are for question 2 of the Reproducible Figures assignment. The aim of this assignment is to write code that is reproducible, open and communicable to anyone who explores it. The file "Assignment_Q2.Rmd" can be knitted once all other files have been downloaded and all necessary packages installed.

Note: Packages to install can be found near the top of the rmd file as an inline comment. There are other functions that can be found as inline comments, such as those to do with saving data and figures as files.
